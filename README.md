# Attempts_At_Using_Mikas_VGA
  This is the respository for attempts that we made at using and understanding the vga module that was given by Mika Burmester. This repository is specifically for the failed attempts. These files were mostly unused in the final design and they were made as various attempts at understanding how the vga module works and how to use it.
